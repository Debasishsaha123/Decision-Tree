# Decision-Tree
 Decision tree is the most powerful and popular tool for classification and prediction. A Decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each internal node
 
 denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. 

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.
